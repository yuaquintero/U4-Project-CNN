# U4-Project-CNN
This project contains a model for scene classification into 6 diferents clases wich are: [buildings','forest''glacier','mountain','sea', 'street']. 

## Data

The training data set contains 14034 imagens of size 150x150 and the dataset to test contains 3000 images.
## Model

The model it's a CNN with two convolutional layers with 32 and 64 neurons. Two maxpolling layers and one fully conected layer with 256 neurons.

## Results

In the first train, Overfit is evident, so transformations were made using the Keras ImageDataGenerator class. This notebook shows the results of both experiments
